Question,Answer
1. What are the main causes of infectious diseases?,"The main causes of infectious diseases are not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it does mention that infection involves a complicated interaction between parasites and hosts, and that successful parasites must utilize specific strategies to overcome the host's defense mechanisms.

It also mentions that microbial factors, such as bacteria, viruses, and parasites, can cause infections, but it does not provide a comprehensive list of the main causes of infectious diseases.

If you're looking for a general answer, the main causes of infectious diseases typically include:

* Bacteria
* Viruses
* Parasites (such as protozoa and helminths)
* Fungi
* Prions

However, this information is not explicitly stated in the provided context."
2. What factors affect the likelihood of acquiring infections?,"The text doesn't explicitly state the factors that affect the likelihood of acquiring infections. However, it does mention that the successful parasite must utilize specific strategies to overcome the host's defense mechanisms, and that the interaction between parasites and host is complicated and involves several steps. 

It also mentions that the introduction of foreign bodies, alteration of the natural flora with antibiotics, and treatment with suppressive drugs such as steroids can increase the likelihood of infection."
3. How can medical care increase the patient's risk of acquiring an infection?,"According to the provided context, medical care can increase the patient's risk of acquiring an infection in several ways:

1. Through contact with pathogens during hospitalization.
2. Through injections.
3. Through surgical incisions.

These are the ways mentioned in the context where medical care can increase the patient's risk of acquiring an infection."
4. What are the two major classes of immune response?,"The two major classes of immune response are:

1. Innate Immunity (Natural Immunity)
2. Acquired (Adaptive) Immunity"
5. What is the difference between innate and acquired immunity?,"Innate immunity and acquired immunity are two major classes of immune responses.

Innate immunity (Natural Immunity) is the first line of defense and serves to protect the host without prior exposure to the infectious agent. This immune response is nonspecific and has no memory. Examples of innate immunity include skin and mucous membranes, phagocytosis by macrophages and neutrophils, and the complement system.

Acquired (Adaptive) Immunity, on the other hand, is a specific immune mechanism developed against a particular organism. It takes time to develop and has long-standing memory. Acquired immunity has two major arms: cellular immunity (comprising T-lymphocytes and NK cells) and humoral immunity (comprising B-lymphocytes and antibodies produced by plasma cells).

The key differences between innate and acquired immunity are:

1. Specificity: Innate immunity is nonspecific, while acquired immunity is specific to a particular organism.
2. Memory: Innate immunity has no memory, while acquired immunity has long-standing memory.
3. Development: Innate immunity is present from birth, while acquired immunity develops over time after exposure to an infectious agent."
6. What are the two major arms of acquired immunity?,"The two major arms of acquired (adaptive) immunity are:

1. Cellular immunity: comprising T-lymphocytes and NK cells
2. Humeral Immunity: comprising B-Lymphocytes and antibodies produced by plasma cells."
7. What are the methods used for laboratory diagnosis of infections?,"The text does not explicitly mention the methods used for laboratory diagnosis of infections. However, it does mention that the student will be able to ""Describe the most commonly used tests for the diagnosis of malaria"" as one of the learning objectives, but it does not provide the specific methods."
8. What is the optimal therapy for infectious diseases?,"The provided context does not explicitly state the optimal therapy for infectious diseases. However, it does mention that certain infections (e.g. peritonitis, necrotizing fascitis, and abscess) require surgery as a primary means of cure, and antibiotics play an adjunctive role in these cases."
9. What are the different species of Plasmodium that cause malaria in humans?,"According to the provided context, there are four species of Plasmodium that cause malaria in humans:

1. P. falciparum (also called malignant malaria)
2. P. vivax (tertian malaria)
3. P. ovale (tertian malaria)
4. P. malariae (quartan malaria)

It's worth noting that almost all deaths caused by malaria are attributed to P. falciparum."
10. What is the definition of endemicity of malaria based on spleenic rates in children?,The definition of endemicity of malaria based on spleenic rates (palpable spleen) in children is not explicitly stated in the provided context.
